// ===========================================================================
// knowledge-nodes.js  —  ISO 20022 Academy Knowledge Graph (Phase 2)
// ===========================================================================
//
// WHAT THIS IS
//   The academy's content, restructured from "lists of messages" into a GRAPH
//   of knowledge NODES. Every node is shaped like the 9-beat Lesson Spine
//   defined in PHILOSOPHY.md, so any page can render any node the same way.
//
// WHY IT'S A SEPARATE, ADDITIVE FILE (Phase 2 rule: "app runs unchanged")
//   Nothing references `knowledgeNodes` yet. It loads alongside data.js and
//   sits idle until Phases 3-7 wire it into app.js / ui.js. Dropping it in
//   cannot break the live site.
//
//   To activate: add  <script src="assets/js/knowledge-nodes.js"></script>
//   in index.html AFTER data.js and BEFORE ui.js. (Adding the tag changes no
//   behavior on its own — the object is just available on `window`.)
//   Alternatively, paste this whole block at the end of data.js.
//
// THE LAW (PHILOSOPHY.md): every node begins with a HUMAN QUESTION; raw XML
//   never appears before beat 7. The field order below mirrors the spine so
//   it's obvious if a beat is missing.
